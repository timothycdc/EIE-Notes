# BUSI60040: Corporate Finance Online

Full notes, complete. Not all exercises and live classes are covered. The module syllabus was refreshed 1-2 years ago.

Foreword from my notes:

The notes are intended to keep a rough track of the (rather lacking) syllabus found on the website [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/undergraduate/bpes/#programme-content). The notes here themselves are far from a proper curriculum in corporate finance, more interested readers can consult a better textbook [here](https://book.ivo-welch.info/home/).


From the Business School website:


This module aims to give an overview of the two key financial instruments: Stocks and Bonds. It will also introduce the key derivatives marketing: Futures and Options.
