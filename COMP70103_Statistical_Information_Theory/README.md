# COMP70015 Mathematics for Machine Learning

- Experimenting with a new tufte-book layout! 
- Be warned a lot of the LaTeX here is very hacky. Expect it to clean up over future iterations
- I have modified the tufte-book style, and while I subjectively like the design of it, the changes are definitely not to the purist's tastes. 
- I have added numbered sections, the original latex toc, shrunk margins, and combined with coloured boxes â€“ which may disagree with Edward Tufte's conventional philosophy, but after all, these are nice notes meant to convey technical concepts at a balance between convenience of typing, concise clarity, and detailedness, not to be a book at a publishable standard.
- Still, as always, very much a work in progress
