# ELEC60019 Machine Learning

- The EEE Department's version of the Machine Learning course.
- I got a bit too carried away in statistical learning theory in some areas.
- These notes are unfinished and have several notational and content errors, including some missing detail from the slide. 
- These errors will be documented after term ends. 
- I do not recommend using these notes for reference during the open-book exam.
- I attempted to cover more of the mathematics behind the concepts, so this might blur the boundary between what is examinable or not â€“ some have been separated under callouts as 'Extra, Not Assessed'.
- Again, these notes are not guaranteed mistake-free nor a perfect match to the syllabus. Use at your own risk, but for your convenience of learning.
