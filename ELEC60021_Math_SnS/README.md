# ELEC60021 Mathematics for Signals and Systems

- Pretty much a Applied Linear Algebra course centred more towards Electrical/Information Engineering students.
- There are no notes (aside from slides) for this module, so I decided to write my own to help structure my understanding.
- I attempted to cover more of the mathematics behind the concepts, so this might blur the boundary between what is examinable or not.
- Again, these notes are not guaranteed mistake-free nor a perfect match to the syllabus. Use at your own risk, but for your convenience of learning.

- ### To do
- [ ] Proper derivation and labelling of Least-Squares
- [ ] Figure 3.3 Caption
- [ ] Complete Section 3.7.2
