# EIE-Notes

LaTeX notes with compiled PDFs written during 3rd year EIE at Imperial College London.
My LaTeX configs for boxes design are adapted from @OliverKillane's repo [here](https://github.com/OliverKillane/Imperial-Computing-Notes)

Feel free to contribute if you have any improvements or error fixes.
