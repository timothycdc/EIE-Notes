# EIE-Notes

LaTeX notes with compiled PDFs written during 3rd year EIE at Imperial College London.
My LaTeX configs for some designs are adapted from @OliverKillane's repo [here](https://github.com/OliverKillane/Imperial-Computing-Notes)

Some of the notation is inconsistent and the notes are not guaranteed to be a mistake-free nor a perfect match to the (current) syllabi. Use at your own risk, but for your convenience of learning.

Feel free to contribute if you have any improvements or error fixes.
