# ELEC60002 Statistical Signal Processing and Inference

Work in progress up to Lecture 3 + LSE, more to come.

Foreword from my notes:

The notes are intended to be a gentle introductory supplement to the well-documented course notes, and not a full replacement with all the bells and whistles (e.g. real life use-cases, mathematical examples). The full notes are available on Professor Danilo Mandic’s website [here](https://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~mandic/courses.htm).

Thus, a better title for this document would be 'Elements of Statistical Signal Processing and Inference’.
