\section{Applications of Statistical Signal Processing}

Uses of Statistical Signal Processing
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forecasting financial data
    \item Supply-demand modelling
    \item Pandemic spread modelling
\end{itemize}

Main theme: making sense from data based on historical observations. \\

There are two kinds of statistics: descriptive statistics used to describe data, and inferential statistics that try to gather generalisations from random observations. 

Uses of Statistical Inference
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adaptive learning algorithms like noise-cancelling headphones
    \item Neural networks for classification, prediction, denoising
    \item Financial modelling
\end{itemize}

Prerequisites:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic statistics knowledge, refer to slide 5 of Lecture 1 notes.
    \item Signals and systems knowledge from 2nd year.
\end{itemize}

Learning goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random signals (real-world discrete-time), their properties and statistical descriptors
    \item Linear stochastic models
    \item Grounding in linear estimation theory
    \item Parametric (model-based) and nonparametric (data-driven) modelling
    \item Optimal estimators for random signals with performance bounds
    \item Least squares methods
    \item Adaptive estimation for nonstationary data
\end{itemize}
